But I think it lacked more torture options.\"", "Social media users in Brazil expressed fury over the game, and a number of prominent politicians urged officials to hold tech companies to a higher standard.", "\"Blatant racism,\" tweeted Renata Souza, a black activist and regional politician from Rio de Janeiro.", "\"The image illustrating the game has a white man surrounded by black men. It is absurdly violent. Google and the developer must answer for this crime of hatred and racism.\"", "And Denise Pessoa, a lawmaker with the governing PT political party, wrote on Twitter: \"IT IS ABSURD that a game that spreads cruelty and hate speech against black people is available.
