", "The company \"sacrificed privacy for profits\", he added.", "Similarly, the FTC said Ring - which Amazon bought in 2018 - allowed \"thousands of employees and contractors\" to watch recordings of customers' private spaces.", "They were able to view and download customers' sensitive video data for their own purposes, the body said. ", "Amazon told the BBC in a statement that \"Ring promptly addressed the issues at hand on its own years ago, well before the FTC began its inquiry\". ", "But according to the complaint, one employee viewed thousands of video recordings belonging to female users of Ring cameras that \"surveilled intimate spaces in their homes such as their bathrooms or bedrooms\".", "The employee was only stopped once their actions were spotted by a colleague, it said. ", "\"Ring's disregard for privacy and security exposed consumers to spying and harassment,\" Mr Levine said. \"The FTC's order makes clear that putting profit over privacy doesn't pay.\"", "Amazon said: \"While we disagree with the FTC's claims regarding both Alexa and Ring, and deny violating the law, these settlements put these matters behind us.\" ", "The company added that it will continue to invent more privacy features on behalf of customers."]}
