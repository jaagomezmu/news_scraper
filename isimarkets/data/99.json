It's the same for all four of us - someone says, 'no' - it's a no.\"", "\"We can celebrate 50 years of Abba without us being on stage,\" adds Ulvaeus.", "In an interview to mark the first anniversary of their virtual concert residency, Abba Voyage, which features digital recreations of the four band members.
