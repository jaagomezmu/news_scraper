I know.\" ", "Sophie is now helping Romanian prosecutors with the investigation.", "I also put to him the concerns of schoolteachers, senior police figures and rights campaigners about the influence of his views.

", "Before we had even left the building, Mr Tate posted a message on social media promising to publish his own version of the interview, which he did shortly after.", "The BBC has followed his case closely since the end of last year, when the Tate brothers were taken into custody, and has spoken to witnesses, former employees, neighbours and associates, and those involved in the investigation, to piece together an accurate picture of the Tate brothers' time in Romania.
