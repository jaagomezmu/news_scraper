It's a basic human right access, and it's everybody's responsibility,\" she says. ", "\"I think it is especially important to highlight when our own government is maybe misusing features and just let them know where they can improve.\"", "Becky says it's especially bad from Rishi Sunak because the government published guidance for public bodies to make their websites and apps accessible in 2018.", "\"I know that the guidance doesn't specifically reference social media,\" she says.", "\"But I think it's reasonable to expect that communications teams of a key public figure such as the prime minister also makes their social media posts accessible.\"", "In a statement, Number 10 said: \"We use a broad range of methods and channels to communicate with the public and aim to ensure that they are as accessible as possible.", "\"That includes using alternative text on our social channels.\"", "Follow Newsbeat on Twitter and YouTube.", "Listen to Newsbeat live at 12:45 and 17:45 weekdays - or listen back here."]}
